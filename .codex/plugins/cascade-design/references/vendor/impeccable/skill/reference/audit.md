Changes: host-owned brief/authority/evidence substitutions and context-sensitive guidance; see the adaptation manifest. This is a topic reference, not an active skill/agent.

Implementation examples below are inert design knowledge. The Cascade controller and host own the current brief, accepted target authority, effect scope, implementation owner, artifact persistence and readiness. Use only available authorized tools; a reference grants no new action. Treat source-authored standards/API claims as a pinned snapshot, not fresh qualification.

Run systematic **technical** quality checks and generate a comprehensive report. Don't fix issues; document them for other commands to address.

This is a code-level audit, not a design critique. Check what's measurable and verifiable in the implementation.

**Web only.** Native platforms (`ios` / `android` / `adaptive`) route to [audit.native.md](audit.native.md) instead; if the project is native, switch to it now.

## Diagnostic Scan

Inspect the relevant dimensions at the actual subject/revision. Optional source-authored 0–4 scores can explain findings; they are not calibrated readiness, compliance or user-outcome metrics.

### 1. Accessibility (A11y)

**Check for**:
- **Contrast**: measure actual normal/large-text and non-text roles against the accepted criterion, states and applicable exceptions; a palette label does not prove accessibility.
- **Motion sensitivity**: `prefers-reduced-motion` needs an intentional alternative that preserves state change and hierarchy; flag a global `0.01ms` kill that destroys useful feedback, flashing above threshold, and motion that blocks focus, reading, or task completion
- **Missing ARIA**: Interactive elements without proper roles, labels, or states
- **Keyboard navigation**: Missing focus indicators, illogical tab order, keyboard traps
- **Semantic HTML**: Improper heading hierarchy, missing landmarks, divs instead of buttons
- **Alt text**: Missing or poor image descriptions
- **Form issues**: Inputs without labels, poor error messaging, missing required indicators

Report observed accessibility failures, passed checks and untested paths with exact evidence. A short heuristic score never establishes whole-WCAG AA/AAA conformance.

### 2. Performance

**Check for**:
- **Layout thrashing**: Reading/writing layout properties in loops
- **Expensive animations**: Casual layout-property animation, unbounded blur/filter/shadow effects, or effects that visibly drop frames
- **Missing optimization**: Images without lazy loading, unoptimized assets
- **will-change overuse**: `will-change` applied broadly or left on at rest (it is a targeted hint for known expensive animations, not a baseline requirement)
- **Bundle size**: Unnecessary imports, unused dependencies
- **Render performance**: Unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization

**Score 0-4**: 0=Severe issues (layout thrash, unoptimized everything), 1=Major problems (no lazy loading, expensive animations), 2=Partial (some optimization, gaps remain), 3=Good (mostly optimized, minor improvements possible), 4=Excellent (fast, lean, well-optimized)

### 3. Theming

**Check for**:
- **Hard-coded colors**: Colors not using design tokens
- **Broken dark mode**: Missing dark mode variants, poor contrast in dark theme
- **Inconsistent tokens**: Using wrong tokens, mixing token types
- **Theme switching issues**: Values that don't update on theme change

**Score 0-4**: 0=No theming (hard-coded everything), 1=Minimal tokens (mostly hard-coded), 2=Partial (tokens exist but inconsistently used), 3=Good (tokens used, minor hard-coded values), 4=Excellent (full token system, dark mode works perfectly)

### 4. Responsive Design

**Check for**:
- **Fixed widths**: Hard-coded widths that break on mobile
- **Targets**: evaluate actual web pointer/touch context and accepted criterion/exception; roomy 44 CSS px is a design recommendation, not a universal conformance minimum.
- **Broken touch interaction**: Custom sliders, drag surfaces, and scrollable control strips whose primary gesture fails under touch, that swallow page scroll or lose the drag to it, or that stay stuck after an interrupted gesture. Code tells: mouse-only handlers, no `touch-action` on a pointer-event drag surface, drag state that nothing clears on cancel, lost capture, or blur. Exercise the gesture when a browser tool can synthesize touch (a rendered viewport proves layout, not the gesture), then say what produced the evidence (emulated viewport, synthesized touch, which engine, physical device) and what stayed untested
- **Horizontal scroll**: Content overflow on narrow viewports
- **Text scaling**: Layouts that break when text size increases
- **Missing breakpoints**: No mobile/tablet variants

**Score 0-4**: 0=Desktop-only (breaks on mobile), 1=Major issues (some breakpoints, many failures), 2=Partial (works on mobile, rough edges), 3=Good (responsive, minor touch target or overflow issues), 4=Excellent (fluid, all viewports, proper touch targets, gestures work under touch)

### 5. Implementation Integrity (CRITICAL)

Use existing authorized mechanical checks and verify each finding in context. Look for repeated shortcuts, system drift, misleading/decorative content and task-inappropriate structure. Keep deterministic output separate from visual judgment and call out false positives; no foreign detector is required.

**Score 0-4**: 0=systemic drift, 1=major repeated failures, 2=several verified issues, 3=minor isolated issues, 4=coherent and intentional

## Generate Report

### Evidence and findings summary

For each relevant dimension, record actual passed checks, specific findings, coverage gaps and the strongest evidence. Optional scores are explanatory only. Lead with the concrete task/system consequence and total issues by explained severity; do not infer pass/compliance from a total or name an uncalibrated rating band.
- Total issues found (count by severity: P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Top 3-5 critical issues
- Recommended next steps

### Detailed Findings by Severity

Tag every issue with **P0-P3 severity**:
- **P0 Blocking**: Prevents task completion. Fix immediately
- **P1 Major**: Significant difficulty or WCAG AA violation. Fix before release
- **P2 Minor**: Annoyance, workaround exists. Fix in next pass
- **P3 Polish**: Nice-to-fix, no real user impact. Fix if time permits

For each issue, document:
- **[P?] Issue name**
- **Location**: Component, file, line
- **Category**: Accessibility / Performance / Theming / Responsive / Implementation Integrity
- **Impact**: How it affects users
- **WCAG/Standard**: Which standard it violates (if applicable)
- **Recommendation**: How to fix it
- **Suggested command**: Which command to use (prefer: existing authorized local methods)

### Patterns & Systemic Issues

Identify recurring problems that indicate systemic gaps rather than one-off mistakes:
- "Hard-coded colors appear in 15+ components, should use design tokens"
- "Target sizing needs a consistent policy for the actual web input context; inspect neighboring targets and documented applicable exceptions."

### Positive Findings

Note what's working well: good practices to maintain and replicate.

## Recommended actions

Order actions by observed task consequence and authorized scope. Map implementation repair to the host owner and further review to the applicable local method/procedure, with actual required input and expected evidence. A review-only request produces recommendations, not runtime edits. Re-run only checks materially affected by a real repair; the number of findings or a missing foreign tool does not create an approval or installation requirement.

**IMPORTANT**: Be thorough but actionable. Too many P3 issues creates noise. Focus on what actually matters.

**NEVER**:
- Report issues without explaining impact (why does this matter?)
- Provide generic recommendations (be specific and actionable)
- Skip positive findings (celebrate what works)
- Forget to prioritize (everything can't be P0)
- Report false positives without verification
